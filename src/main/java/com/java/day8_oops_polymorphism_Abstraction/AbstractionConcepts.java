	//What is the abstraction ?
	//Ans : Hiding something. In java we hide implementation logic
	
	//2 ways
	
	//1. Abstract Class
	//   0 to 100% abstraction. 
	//   Abstract class can hold both abstract methods as well as concrete methods
	
	//Can a normal class extend an Abstract Class ?? - YES
	
	//Can I create the Object of Abstract Class ?? - NO
	
	//Can I make an abstract method private ?? NO
	
	
	//2. Interface
	//known as pure abstraction - 100% abstraction
	// interface allows multiple inheritance
