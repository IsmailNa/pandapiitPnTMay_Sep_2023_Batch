	//What is Data Structure?
	//Way to store data in an efficient way
	//efficient means - Time and Space complexities
	
	//java has 8 primitive data types. So we can store data in a simple fashion
	//int a=1; or char c = 'a'; 
	
	//Difference between Primitive DS and non-primitive DS
	//Primitive DS cannot store multiple data
	
	int a = 1;
	char c = 'z';
	
	String S= "Selenium";
	int[] b= {1,2,3,4,5,6};
	
	//you can do search operation
	//sorting operation
	
	//What is Collection Framework?
	//it is part of Non-Primitive DS and it also a pre-defined API
